## Network Attached Storage (NAS) üìÄ
> What is NAS for?
> - Storing/sharing materials for research, e.g., datasets, codes, etc.
> - Being linked to workstations for remote development.

<mark>DO NOT</mark> keep any sensitive information on NAS!

1. **Gaining Access To NAS**
- Ask the administrator for a username and a password
- Change the password after the first login with web interface at [https://223.195.240.67:1006/](https://223.195.240.67:1006/)
> You might experience a problem of unsecured connection. It is OKüôÑ to ignore the warning and proceed to the website.

> However, with an unsecured connection, your data, especially your username and password will be transmitted in plain textü§Æ. So, it is recommended to contact the administrator to install a SSL certificate on your PC, especially if you are using a public network and you share the same username and password with other services.
2. **Connecting To NAS**
   - NAS Web Interface
     - Open a web browser and go to [https://223.195.240.67:1006/](https://223.195.240.67:1006/)
     - Enter your username and password
     - Click [Sign In]
     - NAS Web Interface main features include:
       - [File Station] is for managing files and folders
       - [Personal] contains your account information
   - SFTP Clients  
        Please refer to [Data Transfer üöö](./cilab/#data-transfer--and-environment-setup-) for more information
3. **NAS Folder Structure**
    - *your_username* contains your personal data.
    - *PAPER-WORK* is for storing our lab's documents.
    - *PUBLIC* is for sharing materials from graduated members, this folder is read-only.

## GPU Workstations
### Connecting To Workstations üñ•Ô∏è
Let's start with the most common way to connect to a workstation, which is using SSH with a terminal.
   - Ask the administrator for a username and a password
   - Open a terminal
   - Connect to the workstation with the following command
     ```bash
     ssh username@workstation_ip -p 1004
     ```
   - Enter your password
   - You are now connected to the workstation

### Environment Setup üöß
For the most part, you will be working on GPU workstations with Python based projects. Here is an example of how to set up your Python environment:
1. **Connect to the workstation with SSH**
2. **Install Anaconda**
   - Download the latest version of Anaconda for Linux, for example, *Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh* 
     ```bash
     wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
     ```
   - Install Anaconda by following the instructions
   - Create a new environment with Python 3.9
     ```bash
     conda create -n <your environment name here> python=3.9
     ```
     Replace `<your environment name here>` with any name you want.
   - Activate the environment
     ```bash
     conda activate <your environment name here>
     ```
     You should see the environment name in the terminal prompt which is `(csd)` in the figure below.

3. **Hello World!**
   - Let's start with a simple Python script
   - Use `nano` text editor to create a Python script
     ```bash
     nano hello.py
     ```
   - Enter the following content
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```
   - Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + O` and then `Enter`
   - Close `nano` by pressing `Ctrl + X`
   - Run the file with the following command
     ```bash
     python hello.py
     ```
     You should see the output `Hello, World!` in the terminal.
### Data Transfer üöö
- Before starting to work on GPU workstations, you need to know how to transfer your data between your PC, NAS, and GPU workstations. Here are some tools that you can use:
  - sd
### Interacting With Workstations üñ•Ô∏è
#### Terminal üí™
#### Using VSCode üöÄ
#### With X2Go üöÇ
