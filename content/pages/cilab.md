## Network Attached Storage (NAS) 📀

> What is NAS for?
> - Storing/sharing materials for research, e.g., datasets, codes, etc.
> - Being linked to workstations for remote development.

> You might experience a problem of unsecured connection. It is OK🙄 to ignore the warning and proceed to the website. However, with an unsecured connection, your data, especially your user name and password will be transmitted in plain text🤮. So, it is recommended to contact the administrator to install a SSL certificate.
