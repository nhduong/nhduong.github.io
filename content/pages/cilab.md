## Network Attached Storage (NAS) üìÄ
> What is NAS for?
> - Storing/sharing materials for research, e.g., datasets, codes, etc.
> - Being linked to workstations for remote development.

<mark>DO NOT</mark> keep any sensitive information on NAS!

1. **Gaining Access To NAS**
- Ask the administrator for a username and a password
- Change the password after the first login with web interface at <a href="https://223.195.240.67:1006" target="_blank">https://223.195.240.67:1006</a>
> You might experience a problem of unsecured connection. It is OKüôÑ to ignore the warning and proceed to the website.

> However, with an unsecured connection, your data, especially your username and password will be transmitted in plain textü§Æ. So, it is recommended to contact the administrator to install a SSL certificate on your PC, especially if you are using a public network and you share the same username and password with other services.
1. **Connecting To NAS**
   - NAS Web Interface
     - Open a web browser and go to <a href="https://223.195.240.67:1006" target="_blank">https://223.195.240.67:1006</a>
     - Enter your username and password
     - Click [Sign In]
     - NAS Web Interface main features include:
       - [File Station] is for managing files and folders
       - [Personal] contains your account information
   - SFTP Clients  
        Please refer to [Data Transfer üöö](./cilab/#data-transfer-) for more information
2. **NAS Folder Structure**
    - *your_username* contains your personal data.
    - *PAPER-WORK* is for storing our lab's documents.
    - *PUBLIC* is for sharing materials from graduated members, this folder is read-only.

## GPU Workstations
### Reservation üìÖ
Head to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1NsKRx_1eLOUUYIa9rYNJWEGnNnKrfy3VcYRzI4kRusA" target="_blank">CILAB_Shared_GPUs_Sheet</a> to reserve the GPU(s) you need. In summary,
- <mark>Only make a reservation</mark> when your <mark>code is ready</mark> to run as other members might need GPU(s) more urgently.
- <mark>Cancel the reservation</mark> if you <mark>do not need GPU(s)</mark> anymore.  

For more information, please ask questions in our KakaoTalk group.
### Connecting To Workstations üñ•Ô∏è
Let's start with the most common way to connect to a workstation, which is using SSH with a terminal.
   - Ask the administrator for a username and a password
   - Open a terminal
   - Connect to the workstation with the following command
     ```bash
     ssh username@workstation_ip -p 1004
     ```
   - Enter your password
   - You are now connected to the workstation  
     ![regular](../figs/env/0.ssh_terminal.png)
### Environment Setup üöß
For the most part, you will be working on GPU workstations with Python based projects. Here is an example of how to set up your Python environment:
1. **Connect to the workstation with SSH**
2. **Install Anaconda**
   - Download the latest version of Anaconda for Linux, for example, *Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh* 
     ```bash
     wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
     ```
   - Enter the following command to install Anaconda
     ```bash
     bash Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
     ```
      then follow the instructions to complete the installation.
   - Create a new environment with Python 3.9
     ```bash
     conda create -n <your environment name here> python=3.9
     ```
     Replace `<your environment name here>` with any name you want.
   - Activate the environment
     ```bash
     conda activate <your environment name here>
     ```
     You should see the environment name in the terminal prompt which is `(csd)` in the figure below.  
     ![regular](../figs/env/1.env.png)
3. **Hello World!**
   - Let's start with a simple Python script
   - Use `nano` text editor to create a Python script
     ```bash
     nano hello.py
     ```
   - Enter the following content
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```
   - Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + O` and then `Enter`
   - Close `nano` by pressing `Ctrl + X`
   - Run the file with the following command
     ```bash
     python hello.py
     ```
     You should see the output `Hello, World!` in the terminal!
### Interacting With Workstations üñ•Ô∏è
<!-- #### Terminal üí™ -->
<!-- #### Using VSCode üöÄ -->
VSCode is an All-in-One powerful editor that runs on your local machine. It can be used to connect to a remote workstation for develpment. It comes with a lot of useful features via extensions. This guide will show you how to set up and use VSCode to connect to a CILab workstation.
- Download and install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">VSCode</a> on your <mark>local machine</mark> (NOT the workstation!)
- Remember to make a reservation before using a workstation. And, the reservations <mark>MUST be canceled</mark> if you are not using the workstations anymore.
- SSH configuration:  
*(skip this step if you have already done it before.)*
  + Run VS Code on your local machine.</li>
  + Install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh" target="_blank">Remote-SSH extension</a> in VSCode  
  ![regular](../figs/vscode/1.ssh.png)
  + Press `F1` (Windows/Linux) or `‚áß‚åòP` (macOS) to open `Command Palette`
  + Type `Remote-SSH: Open SSH Configuration File...` and press `Enter`  
  ![regular](../figs/vscode/2.config.png)
  + Select:
    - Linux: `~/.ssh/config`
    - Windows: `C:\Users\your_username\.ssh\config`
    - macOS: `/Users/your_username/.ssh/config`  

  then press `Enter`.
  + Add the following lines to the file:
    ```bash
    Host any_name_you_like
        HostName workstation_ip_address
        User your_username
        Port 1004
    ```
  + Save the file and close it.
- Connecting to a server
  + Run VS Code on your local machine (if you haven't.)
  + Press `F1` (Windows/Linux) or `‚áß‚åòP` (macOS) to open `Command Palette`
  + Type `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...` and press `Enter`  
  ![regular](../figs/vscode/3.connect.png)
  + Select the name you set in the previous step and press `Enter`
  + Enter your password and press `Enter`
  + Wait for the connection to be established
  + You should see the workstation name in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window. In the example below, the server name is `cilabws05`  
  ![regular](../figs/vscode/4.connected.png)
  + Let's look for available GPUs. Open a new terminal by selecting `Terminal -> New Terminal` from the top menu
  + Type `nvidia-smi` and press `Enter`
  + In the example below, *GPU #0* is being used by someone else while *GPUs #1*, *#2*, and *#3* are free.  
  ![regular](../figs/vscode/5.nvidia-smi.png)

Now everything is set up and you can start working on the workstation with VS Code!

> *Tips and tricks*
>   - With VS Code, in general, a task, e.g., openning a terminal instance, can be done in multiple ways. Play around with it to find the way you like.
>   - In VS Code, most of the tasks can be done via `Command Palette` and they can also be associated with keyboard shortcuts. Click the wheel icon in the bottom left corner then select `Keyboard Shortcuts` for more information.
>   - In addition the Remote-SSH extension, you can also install other extensions in VS Code. For example, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens" target="_blank">GitLens</a> is useful for managing Git repositories. Recommended extensions: compareit, Edit csv, GitHub Copilot, GitHub Pull Requests and Issues, GitLens, LaTeX Workshop, Markdown All in One, Python, Remote-SSH, Remote Development, TensorBoard, and WSL.
>   - With LaTeX Workshop, VSCode can be used to write and compile LaTeX documents. The output PDF file can be viewed directly in VSCode.
>   - To run code in background, you can use `nohup` command. For example, `nohup python train.py &`. For more information, visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup" target="_blank">nohup</a>. Also, you can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen" target="_blank">screen</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux" target="_blank">tmux</a> for more advanced features.

## Data Transfer üöö
Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is required for transferring data between your PCs, workstations and NAS. There are several SFTP clients available for you to choose from, such as <a href="https://filezilla-project.org" target="_blank">FileZilla</a>, <a href="https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client" target="_blank">Bitvise</a>, etc. For command line based software, <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs" target="_blank">sshfs</a>, <a href="https://rclone.org" target="_blank">rclone</a>, etc. are also available. In this tutorial, we will use FileZilla, `sshfs`, and `rclone` as examples.

- FileZilla  
  FileZilla is a free software and available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is easy to use and provides a user-friendly interface for transferring files between your PCs, workstations and NAS.  
  Here are the steps to make a connection to workstations/NAS via FileZilla:
	+ Download and install <a href="https://filezilla-project.org" target="_blank">FileZilla</a>
	+ Head to `File -> Site Manager -> New Site`
  + Fill in the following information:
    + *Protocol*: SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol
    + *Host*: workstation/NAS's IP address
    + *Port*: 1004
    + *Logon Type*: Normal
    + *User*: your_username
    + *Password*: your_password
  + Click `Connect`  
  ![regular](../figs/trans/1.new_site.png)

	> For the first time you connect to a workstation/NAS, you will be asked to verify the server's fingerprint. Click on the `OK` button to continue.

	> Note that the above steps are for the first time you connect to a workstation/NAS. After that, you can simply select a server and click on the `Connect` button to connect to the server.
	
  In the figure below, the left panel is for your local machine and the right panel is for the remote server (workstation/NAS). You can drag and drop files between these two panels to transfer data. To visually inspect the data, you can right-click on a file and select `View -> Edit` to open it.  
  ![regular](../figs/trans/2.mainwin.png)

- `sshfs`  
	`sshfs` is a command line based software that allows you to mount a remote file system via SFTP. In other words, you can access a folder on the workstation/NAS via a local folder on your PCs. To install sshfs, follow the instructions for <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs" target="_blank">Linux</a>, <a href="https://github.com/winfsp/sshfs-win" target="_blank">Windows</a>, and <a href="https://osxfuse.github.io" target="_blank">macOS</a>.

	To mount a workstation/NAS folder on your local machine, follow these steps:
  + Open a terminal on your local machine.
  + Run the following command to mount a remote folder on your machine:
    ```bash
    sshfs your_username@remote_IP_address:/your_username/remote_folder -p 1004 local_folder
    ```
    > In addition to your PCs, the above command can also be run on a workstation! This way, your workstation can access a NAS folder or another workstation's folder.

    > You will need to execute the above command every time you restart your PCs or workstations.

- `rclone`  
`rclone` is another command line based software that allows you to transfer data between your PCs, workstations and NAS. It supports various cloud storage providers, including Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. To set up `rclone` on a local machine or a workstation, follow these steps:
  + Download <a href="https://rclone.org/downloads" target="_blank">rclone-version-os.zip</a> based on your operating system  
  ![regular](../figs/trans/3.rclone_download.png)
  + Unzip the downloaded file to a folder, for example, `/home/user/rclone`
  + Run the following command to set up a connection to a workstation/NAS:
  ```bash
  cd /home/user/rclone
  ./rclone config
  ```
  + Follow the instructions to set up a new connection:  
    + Enter `n` to create a new remote
    + Enter the following information:
      + *name*: type any name for the connection, for example, `nas`
      + *storage*: type `sftp` for secure file transfer protocol
      + *host*: type the workstation/NAS's IP address
      + *user*: type your username
      + *port*: type `1004`
      + You will be asked to enter your password `SSH password, leave blank to use ssh-agent...`. Type `y` and press `Enter`. After that, enter your password and press `Enter`
      + For the rest of the questions, you can press `Enter` to use the default values until you see the main menu again  
      ![regular](../figs/trans/4.rclone_main.png)
      + From the figure above, you can see that the connection `nas` has been successfully set up. Let's test the connection by running the following command:
      ```bash
      ./rclone lsd nas:/
      ```  
      ![regular](../figs/trans/5.rclone_lsd.png)
      + If you see a list of folders on the workstation/NAS, the connection is successful. You can now transfer data between your PCs, workstations and NAS using `rclone` with the following command:
      ```bash
      ./rclone copy local_folder nas:/remote_folder
      ```
      There are many other features of `rclone` that you might want to explore. Execute `./rclone --help` or visit <a href="https://rclone.org/commands" target="_blank">Rclone Commands</a> for more information.

## SSH Keys üîë
SSH keys are a pair of cryptographic keys used to authenticate a user to a remote server. Basically, you will need two keys:
- A `private key` is kept on your <mark>local machine</mark> at `~/.ssh/id_XXX` (Linux/MacOS) or `C:\Users\your_username\.ssh\id_XXX` (Windows)
- A `public key` is stored on <mark>workstations</mark> at `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

![regular](../figs/sshkeys/SSHkeydiagram.png)  

Instead of entering your password every time you connect to a workstation, our PC and workstations exchange encrypted messages via `private key` and `public key`. This way, you can log in without entering a password. This is more secure and convenient.

To set up SSH keys, follow these steps:
1. **Generate SSH keys**
   > <mark>This step should be done ONLY ONE TIME!</mark>
   - Open a terminal on your <mark>local machine</mark>
   - Run the following command to generate a new SSH key pair
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_comment"
     ```
     where `your_comment` is any text you want, for example, `cilab`
     - You will be asked to enter a file name to save the key pair. Press `Enter` to use the default file name `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` 
       (Linux/MacOS) or `C:\Users\your_username\.ssh\id_ed25519` (Windows)
     - Next, you will be prompted to enter a passphrase to protect the keys. You can leave it empty by pressing `Enter` or type a passphrase for added security. I personally leave it empty but please choose what you feel comfortable with.
     - After that, your SSH key pair will be generated in the `~/.ssh` directory 
       (Linux/MacOS) or `C:\Users\your_username\.ssh` (Windows) on your <mark>local machine</mark>:
        - `private key` is saved as `id_ed25519`
        - `public key` is saved as `id_ed25519.pub`
2. **Copy the `public key` to the <mark>workstations</mark>**

   Do the following steps for each workstation:
   - Open the `public key` file `id_ed25519.pub` on your <mark>local machine</mark> using Notepad or any text editor
   - Copy its content. For example, it should look like this:
     ```bash
     ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza... your_comment
     ```
   - Open a terminal on your <mark>local machine</mark>
   - Login to a <mark>workstation</mark> using SSH
     ```bash
     ssh your_username@workstation_ip_address -p 1004
     ```
    - Create the `~/.ssh` directory if it does not exist
      ```bash
      mkdir -p ~/.ssh
      ```
    - Paste the content into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the workstation
      ```bash
      echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza... your_comment" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
      ```
      replace `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza... your_comment` with the actual content of your `public key` file.
    - Set the correct permissions for the `~/.ssh` directory and the `authorized_keys` file so that only you can read and write to them
      ```bash
      chmod 700 ~/.ssh
      chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
      ```
    - Exit the workstation
      ```bash
      exit
      ```
3. **Test the SSH key authentication**
   - Open a terminal on your <mark>local machine</mark>
   - Run the following command to test the SSH connection
     - For Linux and macOS:
          ```bash
          ssh your_username@workstation_ip_address -p 1004 -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
          ```
      - For Windows:
          ```bash
          ssh your_username@workstation_ip_address -p 1004 -i C:\Users\your_username\.ssh\id_ed25519
          ```
     where `-i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and `-i C:\Users\your_username\.ssh\id_ed25519` specifies the path to your `private key` file. You can think of this as sending your password to the workstation. But here, the password is not sent in plain text, it is encrypted with your `private key`.
    - If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to log in to the workstation without entering a password.
4. **(Optional) Add the SSH key to the SSH agent**
   - If you want to use the SSH key without entering the path to the key every time, you can add the SSH key to the SSH agent.
   - Start the SSH agent

      - For Linux and macOS, from the terminal in <mark>local machine</mark>,
        ```bash
        eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
        ```
      - For Windows,
        - Open `Services` by following one of these methods
          - Option 1: Press `Windows + R` to open the Run dialog, type `service.msc` and press `Enter`
          - Option 2: Press `Start Menu`, type `services` and press `Enter`
        - Look for `OpenSSH Authentication Agent` in the list
        - Double-click on it to open its properties
        - Set the `Startup type` to `Automatic`
        - Press `Apply`
        - Press `Start` to start the service
        - Press `OK` to close the properties window
   - Add the SSH key to the agent, open a terminal on your <mark>local machine</mark> and run the following command:
      - For Linux and macOS,
        ```bash
        ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ```
      - For Windows,
        ```bash
        ssh-add C:\Users\your_username\.ssh\id_ed25519
        ```
   - Test the SSH connection again
     ```bash
     ssh your_username@workstation_ip_address -p 1004
     ```
     As you can see, you do not need to specify the `private key` file or password anymore!

> In summary,
> - Local machines:
>   - A `private key` file at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (Linux/MacOS) or `C:\Users\your_username\.ssh\id_ed25519` (Windows)
>   - (optional) Adding the `private key` to the SSH agent
> - Workstations: a `public key` at `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

> Notes:
> - After entering `ssh your_username@workstation_ip_address -p 1004`, if you are asked to enter your password, it means that the <mark>SSH key authentication is NOT set up correctly</mark>. Leave a message in our KakaoTalk group for help!
> - <mark>NO NOT</mark> share your `private key` `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or `C:\Users\your_username\.ssh\id_ed25519` with anyone. You can think of it as your password!
> - If you want to use the same SSH key on multiple workstations and multiple local machines, you can copy the `public key` to all the workstations using the <mark>step 2 above</mark> and `private key` to all your local machines.
> - If you configure the SSH agent correctly, you can login to a workstation via <mark>VSCode</mark> without entering your password!
